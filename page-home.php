      <p class='heading'>Why Partner with Dr. Joe Simon?</p>
      <div class='content'>
        <div class='fullContent'>
          <p class='first'>Are you exhausted from the effort of trying to serve your patients, manage costs, and still make time for your family? Can you afford for your star employees to jump ship and set up shop across the street? Dr. Joe has solved these same problems for not only his own practice, but numerous practices just like yours.</p>
          <p>In 2012, Hurricane Sandy obliterated his house and one of his private practices. He had one practice left, but with the entire city in survival mode, no one was showing up to physical therapy. Bleeding money, his financials went completely negative. With his back against the wall and a family to feed, he knew he had to quickly figure something out.</p>
          <p>With nothing to lose, he hired a high-powered marketing company and a 23-year-old personal assistant. In one month, the marketing company came back with zero results, saying they needed more time. Meanwhile, his assistant had gotten creative, going door-to-door and adding thousands of dollars to the practice. So, Dr. Joe got rid of the marketing company and got creative too, looking outside his circle and profession to develop new concepts and ways of thinking.</p>
          <p>Within three months, he made back three times what he’d been making before the hurricane.</p>
          <p>Dr. Joe had to figure it out on his own, and he knows how difficult it can be to have no one to speak with about struggles in your practice. He doesn’t want you to be alone like he was.</p>
          <p>Now, as the Founder of Private Practice Business Academy, Co-Founder of NYC Mastermind, and a Strategic Practice Investor, he helps private practice owners grow their practices to heights they’ve never dreamed of. He’s already worked personally with over 140 private practice owners, 19 hospitals, and 42 non-health-related business. Will he have the privilege of working with you next?</p>
